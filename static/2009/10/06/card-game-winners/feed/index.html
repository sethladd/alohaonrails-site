		<description>Aloha John,

Thanks for taking the time to provide that feedback.  We actually explicitly allowed someone to get the "most" cards and win, because that would be a "social" win.  The whole point of the game was to get people to interact, so if someone wanted to win by convincing people to give him cards, then that's OK by me! :)

We did ensure that there was no way to introduce more cards into the game.  That is, the total number of cards was fixed.

Also, next time, I think we'll actually print them out.

Also Also, the email problems were frustrating.  I had no idea that gmail throttles emails.  That was very frustrating.  Right after the game, Heroku announced support for a more professional email solution.

Thanks again for playing, and for coming to the conference!

		<description>I realize this is a bit late but I did indeed want to give feedback. As you saw Jordan Isip was able to completely trounce the others in just a few hours of playing. I assisted him in this. 

The way we did it was just gathering all the cards people would give to him. There were a lot of people who were not interested in playing the game as well as a bunch of us who were friends who all decided to give Jordan their cards. (There are a lot of players with 0 points.) This allowed Jordan to have a huge deck to work with. If cards were hurting his score he would simply hand them off to me, who was not playing and did not care about my score. I did end up giving these cards to people who wanted them but regardless, I still favored Jordan before anyone else.

This is how he was able to play for just 6 hours and win the game. The game is actually super well designed save for the one flaw we used - there is no limit to the number of cards in the deck. There needs to be a limit otherwise it is just a popularity contest and whatever collects the most cards and spends a bit of time sorting them wins. 

I suggest simply putting a cap on the max number of cards in a deck and you will have a really great game. As of right now it is just about who can collect the most cards which is not really competitive. Maybe also not allow players to hand over all of their cards (they must have at least one card in their hand?)

I hope that helps for the next conference!</description>
