				<h2>Talk Story: Sharing Wisdom, Experience, Knowledge, and Stories</h2>
<p>The theme of Aloha on Rails is &#8220;Talk Story&#8221;.  The presenters and speakers at Aloha on Rails will be telling their stories, sharing their experience and wisdom.  You won&#8217;t find a collection of &#8220;blog posts&#8221; or cursory overviews of over-exposed technologies.  Instead, you&#8217;ll learn from leaders, authors, and innovators as they challenge your perception of your career, your work, and the technologies you use every day.  You&#8217;ll leave these sessions thinking, questioning, and debating.  You&#8217;ll even be entertained.</p>

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#passionate-programmer">(permalink)</a> What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what you&#8217;re aiming for? What defines success?  Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure, ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.  But we didn&#8217;t get into software development so we could fill out spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative and to build great things. From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk through how a software developer can not only succeed but work toward building a remarkable career. We&#8217;ll draw examples from business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for radically succeeding in the software industry.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#hey-is-that-your-database-crying">(permalink)</a> Although ActiveRecord and the new Rails ORMs are optimized for general use cases with relational databases, most enterprise applications will not preform well enough using just the out-of-the-box functionality. Further, since often the ORMs do such a good job of hiding details when interfacing with the database, issues that might severely hinder scalability and performance are difficult to identify and are often ignored. In this talk, I will identify common database performance problems that arise when working with Rails and offer simple techniques and solutions to optimize them and the way your Rails app talks to the database. This talk will also include topics such as Creating good migrations that would make a DBA proud, Addressing common slow operations such as bulk importing records and querying across multiple tables, and Using actual database constraints (and keeping Rails happy).<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#rails-3-public-api">(permalink)</a> Rails 3 is the newest version of Rails, and it comes with significantly more flexibility than previous versions of Rails. If you want to continue using Rails the way you&#8217;ve always used it, the strong system of conventions and defaults that Rails has become known for are still the golden path moving forward.  But if you want to plug in alternatives to Rails&#8217; conventions or hook directly into parts of the internals, Rails 3 provides a power-users&#8217; API that will be supported and maintained moving forward. Yehuda will walk you through the principles of that API, show you how to read and understand the Rails source code so you can customize the framework just the way you want.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#technical-debt">(permalink)</a> Technical debt, a term coined by Ward Cunningham, is incurred by every project when the quick and easy route is taken to solve a problem. As technical debt builds up the problems of cruft begin to multiply. Development slows, bugs increase, deadlines are missed and frustration ensues. At chi.mp we incur technical debt just like any other development team. In this talk I&#8217;ll show you how we approach the reduction of our technical debt. Sometimes it makes sense to refactor existing code and sometimes it makes sense to start all over on certain parts of the code. In either case there are essential elements to successful technical debt reduction, including a solid understanding of the business requirements, a comprehensive test suite and both management and development teams that understand the importance of debt reduction. Ultimately, just like with reduction of financial debt, reducing your technical debt should leave you feeling satisfied and rejuvenated, ready to tackle future programming challenges.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#surviving-the-journey-from-rails-coder-to-manager">(permalink)</a> Most hardcore developers cringe at the idea of putting down their coding tools and becoming a pointy-haired boss. The journey from Rails coder to manager is fraught with peril - from dealing with difficult clients, to keeping your team motivated, to making sure you don&#8217;t lose your technical edge. Here is the story of one man who survived the journey and lived to tell the tale. This talk is geared towards Rails developers in the midst of a transition from coder to manager, those who would like to someday make the transition, or anyone who like to learn more about communicating with clients and coworkers. This will be a wide-ranging talk, but will cover topics such as Dealing with clients, Contract negotiations, Learning a different set of jargon, and How to position yourself for a transition.<br />

In this talk I will first give a quick introduction for those just getting their feet wet with optimizing Rails applications.  However, the majority of the talk will be spent looking at the most useful techniques for optimizations and some of the new libraries that have been released to make it that much easier.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#thinking-in-map-reduce">(permalink)</a> Hadoop is an Apache project that provides a framework for running applications that process vast amounts of data (hundreds of terabytes) on large clusters (thousands of computers) of commodity hardware. The Hadoop framework transparently provides applications both reliability and data motion. Hadoop implements a distributed file system and Map Reduce. This presentation presents the motivation and approach for Hadoop, an overview of the components and architecture, and an overview of some of the tools built on top of Hadoop, such as Hbase, Pig, and Hive.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#introduction-to-pig">(permalink)</a> Pig is a Hadoop sub-project that provides a higher level programming language to describe parallel computation atop Map Reduce. It implements common relational operators such as join and filter and provides ways to incorporate custom user code via user defined functions and streaming. The result is much simpler and more compact code, increased user productivity, and reduced maintenance time compared to writing Java for Map Reduce. At the same time, Pig stays faithful to the spirit of Map Reduce whereby a user program specifies a simple sequence of steps for the system to obey. The talk will introduce Pig and its programming model, contrast it with Hadoop¹s model and provide motivation to use Pig as the preferred programming paradigm for most applications. The performance tradeoffs will also be discussed.<br />

Fresh off using BitKeeper, no distributed version control system existed in April 2005 that would handle the kernel, so two were started within days of each other by two Linux kernel hackers - Mercurial and Git.  This story will go back and see how and why each system made it&#8217;s early and key decisions and should help the audience understand the fundamental differences between the systems, understand Git itself better and think about Version Control as a system in a different light.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#design">(permalink)</a> Design is the single most important aspect of new product development. Whether you&#8217;re building a web app or a great burrito, delivering a consistent, cohesive experience is required. Though &#8216;design&#8217; is widely acknowledged as vital, the scope of its impact is often grossly underestimated and thoroughly misunderstood. Design isn&#8217;t just marketing and advertising hoopla, it is the holistic, analytical thinking that is at the root of every successful brand and needs to be at the front of every entrepreneur&#8217;s mind. As a programmer, design is the difference between simply identifying and solving the problem and doing so elegantly (and profitably). Delivered by an engineer and a usability guru disguised as designers, this session will break down buzzwords and deliver a practical perspective on the real steps (and the commitment and vigilance) it takes to build, implement and maintain a successful brand.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#grand-unified-theory-of-software-design">(permalink)</a> Many words of programming wisdom have been written to promote the idea of low coupling between modules.  &#8220;Prefer delegation over inheritance&#8221;, &#8220;The Law of Demeter&#8221; are examples of these words of advice. But why does delegation introduce less coupling then inheritance.  And how does the law of Demeter reduce coupling?  To understand these issues, we will look at the concept of &#8220;connascence&#8221; how it appears to unify many different design principles under an overall view of coupling.  We will also talk about oatmeal and physics.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#domain-driven-rails">(permalink)</a> As Rails continues to gain popularity, and the community behind it matures, Rails is thrust into domains of increasing complexity.  As anyone who&#8217;s been developing in Rails for a while knows, Ruby and Rails are particularly good tools for modeling this complexity.  However, very little emphasis has been placed on how to *manage* this complexity.  &#8220;Domain-Driven Design&#8221; is a set of principles, patterns, and practices (detailed in a book of the same name) that help developers manage the complexity that comes along with working on large projects in interesting domains.  The two ideas that I will focus on are Aggregates and Bounded Contexts.  I will cover such topics as 1) your 1400 line user.rb - why it sucks and what to do about it, 2) management in the small: breaking up objects, designing aggregates, or, why not all entities are created equal, and 3) management in the large: identifying bounded contexts. This talk is intended for developers working on longer-term, larger applications that are running in production and providing value to the business.  I think the ideas in it start to become useful when a Rails app hits the 10k line mark, and are crucial for managing complexity beyond the 30k line mark.  It&#8217;s an advanced topic and is meant as high-level design and architecture (implemented in real code though!!)<br />

When it comes to doing quality work for others, at expensive prices, you don&#8217;t want immaturity, whether in attitude or practices to derail you. Months ago, Obie proposed an idea which was very controversial, that the community could define a <a href="http://www.railsmaturitymodels.com/">Rails Maturity Model</a> that would describe the ideal way of working with Ruby on Rails. A web application was launched, and later turned into a database showcasing a variety of different maturity models, reflecting different philosophies for approaching Agile software development using Rails. In this session, Obie will moderate a panel discussing the viability and use of &#8220;maturity-model&#8221; type information, and whether the community should care about it.<br />

<dd class="talk-abstract"><a href="/sessions/#ship-your-app-in-a-container">(permalink)</a> The preferred method for deploying Rails has transitioned over the years, from FastCGI to Mongrel, and most recently to Passenger. There is still work to be done, but now a compelling way to develop and deploy Ruby apps, is in a servlet container. Developers can benefit from all the meta-programming power of Ruby, the portability of Java, and then deploy to Google App Engine for unprecedented scalability. We give developers the ability to optimize each URL to use any Rack-based Ruby framework or even servlets, beans, and JSPs. Java developers can quickly put together a simple Sinatra front-end for legacy J2EE code, while Rails developers can easily integrate servlets to do some heavy lifting. The JRuby development environment for Google App Engine runs inside a servlet container, and we have tools that make this easy. With micro-frameworks like Sinatra, or modular frameworks like Rails3, new app instances can spin up on demand, so you avoid paying for servers that sit idle.<br />
