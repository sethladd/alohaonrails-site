As of April 2009, Matthew has moved on into the invigorating world of freelancing. When he&#8217;s not hacking, debugging CSS for Internet Explorer, or producing dozen-page usability analyses, you can find him putting together <a href="http://somewonderfulnoise.com">mixtapes</a> or DJing and performing live musical gigs in downtown Honolulu. He misses the snow in New England and his Japanese is getting rusty.<br />
